## Contribution

I made this software with the porpouse to show my programming skills and
to create a "simple to use" and modern GUI solution to process video files 
throught FFmpeg.

Currently, I don't want collaboration to evolve the source code of this 
software but maybe in the future I'll consider it.

Best regards and enjoy this software.
